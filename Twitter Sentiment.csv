I'm not really sure what the purpose of the video is.  The map is cutoff at the top.  Doesn't feel very inviting overall"

Orange and blue are not good colors for the heatmap because they are complimentary - makes it look like measure on a scale of -x to +x as opposed to 0 to +x. Grey background enforces this because lukewarm states appear greyish brown. Map needs indication of what the colors mean. Chart and bar graph are redundant because they show the same data. Data would probably be better displayed as a table sorted by most tweets to fewest tweets. States with zero tweets are omitted without any explanation. The only text is ""Donald Trump"" repeated 3 times before each piece of information. This tells me nothing of what the charts represent at a glance. "
